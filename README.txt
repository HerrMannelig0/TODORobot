Updated version of book crawler. 
Any questions, ask HerrMannelig0@github.com

Book crawler searches for free books in given websites. 
You can add your own, but there is no guarantee that it would find any records. 
You need to provide html tags for subpages and containers for titles and prices.
Those information are kept in textfile in resources directory - beware that it has rw access!

In final version books are stored in DB, you can view them by bookstoreDB or category.
In beta version books are listed into a textfile.
